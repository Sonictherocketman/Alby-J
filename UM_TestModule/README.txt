# UM_TestModule

This is a testing simulator for the project that compiles natively on Mac OS X. It was built in Xcode and uses the same interior algorithms to determine course corrections and flight paths. The Objective C layer that exists on top of the application is purely to extend compatibility to Mac OS X and it's technologies.

Other than the light sprinkling of Objective-C, the interior of the code is identical to the implementation described in the other versions of the codebase.
