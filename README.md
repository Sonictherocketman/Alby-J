Detailed README's are available inside each projet's directory.

# src_old

The original implementation of the codebase for this project. It was scrapped after numerous memory constraint and hardware related problems that would not allow an apporach like it to succeed for the given hardware configuration.

# UM_TestModule

An Xcode project designed to allow functional testing of the interior algoithms. The interface is Objective-C, the guts are all the same as the other implementations, just wrapped in a Mac app.
