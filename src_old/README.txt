# src_old

This directory contains the incomplete codebase for the project as it was designed to exist.

After complications with managing memory, and replacing hardware, the decision was made to scrap the majority of this code in favor of a far simpler implementation that would run despite the conditions of the hardware. 

The code presented here is incomplete and non-functional, but does reflect the original design goals for the project and the basic code structure that was designed. (i.e. I worked really hard on it, but we couldn't use it. I still want to show it you the public, because I designed it.)

The layout of the code is described in each of the files, with the origin being the UM_MissionController module. 

The actual code for the project does strongly reflect the original design for the project, but the implementation and design strategy were drastically different.

Due to memory management issues, and real-time speed issues the object-oriented approach described in the following files was scraped in favor of a much faster, and lighter approach.
